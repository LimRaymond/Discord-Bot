# Discord-Bot

This discord discord bot retrieve all pinned message from a specific channel and send a random pinned message at a specific time. It can also show the user with the most pinned message as well as all pinned message from an user. This bot was created because of a fun thing we did on our server. We usually pin a message from someone that write either weird stuff or funny stuff and we give him a specific role of the day (like the clown of the day). Anyway enjoy !

## Getting Started

Nothing to say about the projet. My bot is running thanks to repl.it. I had to create a web server that host the bot + using uptime robot so that it send a get request every 5 minutes so that repl.it doesn't make my web server sleep.

### Command

```
!quote # Give you a random pinned message
!show <username> # Give you all pinned message from a specific user
!rank # Give you the number of pinned message from all user that got a pinned message
!help # Give you a list of all command
```

## Built With

* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) - Online IDE + cloud where i host my web server
* [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com) - Monitoring
